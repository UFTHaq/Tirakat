Windows Alpha Release 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello! This is the first ever Alpha Release of Tirakat on Windows!

After 2 weeks of active work since i started (actually no, I personally was
actively working on this only 7 days because i do procastination alot :D). 
I finally shipped the First Alpha Release of Tirakat on Windows! \o/ Wohoo

Forgive me for my cute English error.

What is Tirakat?

It's a simple audio player that can help you with your spiritual practices.
With Tirakat, you can play any religious MP3 you want while keeping track 
of the number of repetitions you've done. For example, if you want to 
recite Al-Fatihah 313 times, just drag and drop the Al-Fatihah MP3 file 
into Tirakat. The app will then keep track of your target and play the MP3 
while counting the number of repetitions you've done.

Tirakat is perfect for people who want to work on their spiritual
practices while they're using their PC or laptop. You can easily keep
track of your repetitions while you're working, so you can stay focused
and motivated, Masyaallah.

Double-click Tirakat.exe. It's not signed or anything cause I don't know
how to do that. So Your Windows may freak out about that a bit. You just
have to believe me that I didn't put in 
viruses in here. At least intentionally...

here is the detail feature:

- Drag&Drop some music onto the window. Only support MP3 format for now.
  Now can only drag&drop mp3 one by one

- After drop the mp3, it will open popup to set your repetition target. 
  Click the input white box to activate the input box. 
  Or you can reset it later in the setting button.

- You can delete your mp3 in setting button.

- It has 2 Mode of playing mp3, repeat and play all song.

- It will count as plus 1 if you play it more than 80% of the mp3.
  And will add it in the last 0.5 seconds.

- It has slider to mp3 timeline. And you can jump and drag it to any place 
  of the song during playing. You can also control it using left and right 
  arrow of your keyboard to move -5 or +5 seconds.

- It has Play/Pause Button. And you can also press Space to Pause/Unpause.

- It has Volume Control. It controls the volume during playing mp3.

- It has Fullscreen Button that hides all of the controls and make it clean.

- Simple, lightweight and easy to use app.

- Don't expect too much from this application! It's not even Beta yet!

- The full source code is available at

- Have fun!
